I am a second-year Ph.D. student in EECS at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) advised by Professor [Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/).  I'm working on reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications, mainly in NLP and robotics. My research has been funded by [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2024-north-america) and [MIT-Google Collaboration Grant](https://computing.mit.edu/mit-google-program-for-computing-innovation/).
