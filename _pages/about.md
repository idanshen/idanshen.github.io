I am a second year Ph.D. student in EECS at [MIT CSAIL]("https://csail.mit.edu") advised by Professor [Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/).  I'm working on reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications, mainly in NLP and robotics.

Before MIT, I worked as an AV applied researcher at [GM Ultra Cruise project]("https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1006-ultracruise.html"). My main research there was on 3D segmentation and detection algorithms from an array of RGB cameras. In my time there, I had the pleasure of working with  [Dr. Netalee Efrat Sela]("https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L0cJiRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra") and [Dr. Shaul Oron]("https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBQnkjIAAAAJ&hl=fil").
Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in EECS from [the Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/) where I worked with Professor [Aviv Tamar]("https://avivt.github.io/avivt/"). During my bachelor's degree I was supported by the Rothschild Fellowship.
